                I was born in Cuba and migrated to this country with my mother when I was 11 years old in hopes for a better future. I owe the life I've lived to my mom and all the sacrifices that she made to provide me with better opportunities and basic human rights which lacked in our native country. I lived in Miami until moving to Chicago just recently with my small-growing family.

                I love live music and traveling - it's 2 of the things I cannot get enough of. When my partner and I are not at a concert, you can find us planning our next trip with friends.

                Fun fact, I have never in my life roller skated...and I'm nearing 30. But I did learn how to ice skate by visiting the rink with highschool friends. Given that it's summer in beautiful Chicago, I am considering buying a pair of inline skates with hopes to learn at a nearby park...cross fingers for no injuries!
